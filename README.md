# iHero

## Problem

You are in the year 3150 and you are in charge of the technology sector responsible for the development of the Heroes distribution management system to combat threats. The system should monitor the threat alert system provided by the UN and allocate heroes for each new threat on the globe.

## DB:

I defined the database in 4 tables (users, hero, threats, hero_threats). With that definition I made an Api with a fake api ([JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)).

## How to run the project

### REQUIREMENTS:

NodeJS v10 or latest.

### REPOSITORY:

Do a 'git clone [git@github.com](mailto:git@github.com):joaoricardoro/challenges.git'

### To Run the API :

- go to challenges/dev/api.
- npm install
- npm run start

### To Run the FRONTEND

- go to challenges/dev/web
- yarn install
- yarn start
